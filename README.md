# CutieSignal

Welcome to the "Cutie Signal" project, a unique way to say sweet things that leverages the WiFi, AP (Access Point) capability of a Heltec ESP32 WiFi LoRa 32 (V3) module. The WiFi can be used to broadcast a different SSIDs every day. Each SSID change (per day in this case) will deliver a cute compliment to a special someone between 17:00 to 22:00 daily (local time). The aim is to keep this system running for about 60 days (that's 60+ compliments). To do this it will require approximately 100,000+ mAh of battery power and require that the ESP32 is put into a deep sleep when outside of it's working hours of 17:00 to 22:00. The batteries and ESP will housed in a waterproof box and placed near my intended recipients dog walking route so they can easily see the signal without inconvenience and get a nice daily compliment. The recipient can connect to the Access Point, which will load an (on-chip) web page containing something nice. In my case the page has a Cutie Code which they will need to continue a quest like adventure as it part of a bigger game. You can of course do anything you want when making your own version of this.

There is also an Instructables if you want to see what it looks like:
