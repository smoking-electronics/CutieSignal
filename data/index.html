        <b>Yay! You've sniffed out the cutie signal! Only cuties can do that.</b>
        <p>

        This ancient device, crafted just for "W05A &amp; PIP," generates the magical Cutie Signal. Every evening from 5 PM to 10 PM, it will activate and broadcast a new complement (via SSID).
        <p>
        Its sole purpose is to make you smile with a fresh compliment for you should you be passing by on a squeaker walk.
        <p>
         But thereâ€™s a catch! The device has only a small battery and so will only last around 60 days, but you get 60 delightful unique compliments.
         <p>
         Also note that weather and temperature changes might affect the real time clock, so it might drift a little towards the end of its life.
        <br>
        <br> Your cutie code is: <b>XC56</b> for the next stage in the adventure!<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        If you're not the intended cutie pie for this signal, please smile too ...but remember, this quest is meant for only one special adventurer!! <br>
        </p>
        <p>
        If you want to make an adventure of your own you will first need to find your own cutie!! Can't help you there but I can make the source code available. You will be able to find it on github at: <br> <a href="https://github.com/smoking-electronics/CutieSignal" target="_blank"> https://github.com/smoking-electronics/CutieSignal</a> enjoy.
